I am self-learning python from a Coursera course: Learn to Program and Analyze Data with Python by Dr. Chuck.\r\n\r\n[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\n> This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, you’ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.\r\n\r\nThe following are the Subcourses that are already done!:\r\n\r\n### Project 1: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)\r\n\r\nThis course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Informatics”.   This course is equivalent to the first half of the 11-week \"Programming for Everybody (Python)\" course.  Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n@PremankuS Premankur Sukul\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nsukulankur@gmail.com",
